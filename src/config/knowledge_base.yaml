  - title: "Replica Count and Fault Tolerance"
    content: "Reducing replicas reduces fault tolerance. Each replica provides redundancy against failures."
    category: "High Availability"
    
  - title: "Single Replica SPOF"
    content: "Single replica introduces a Single Point of Failure (SPOF). No redundancy means any failure causes complete service outage."
    category: "High Availability"
    
  - title: "Minimum Replicas for HA"
    content: "For high availability, maintain at least 3 replicas to survive 1 failure while maintaining quorum."

backup_principles:
  - title: "Backup Frequency Impact"
    content: "Backup frequency directly impacts RPO (Recovery Point Objective) and RTO (Recovery Time Objective). Less frequent backups = more potential data loss."

  - title: "Backup Retention Policy"
    content: "Backup retention must balance storage costs with compliance and recovery requirements."

scaling_principles:
  - title: "Horizontal vs Vertical Scaling"
    content: "Horizontal scaling (add nodes) improves availability. Vertical scaling (bigger nodes) has limits and SPOFs."
    category: "Scalability"
    
  - title: "Auto-scaling Thresholds"
    content: "Auto-scaling thresholds should trigger before resource exhaustion. Recommend 70-80% utilization triggers."

  - title: "Load Balancer Configuration"
    content: "Load balancers must health-check backends. Unhealthy backends should be removed from rotation."

  - title: "DNS TTL Impact"
    content: "Low DNS TTL enables faster failover but increases DNS query load. Balance based on change frequency."

  - title: "Alerting Best Practices"
    content: "Alerts should be actionable, have clear severity levels, and include runbook links."

    content: "Define SLOs based on user experience. Track SLIs continuously to measure against SLOs."
